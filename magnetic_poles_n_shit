Check out the premise of assassins creed, it made me look this up again, humans have never been through it.
on wikipedia

then this article on inverse.com
www.inverse.com/science/earth-magnetic-ffield-flip-chaos#(a bunch of other shit)

The article name is: When earths magnetic poles flip it could be "chaos" for future humans

It's been 780,000 EARTH years since the last flip, thats why magnetic north is cardinal south,
are we due for a new one?

Remember, it takes 2,000 to 7,000 years for the reversal to finish. Humans were not around for the
last one.

remember to look at the picture that shows between reversals and durrent a reversal.
Try explaining that magnetic north and south. theres fucking 3 soundsa nd 3 norths.
Looks like chaos, but is it? Maybe it will resolve some shit or make a point.
I dunno.

The planet has gotten bigger with the hundred+ trillian star dustnessess that fall on earth daily..
Where are these underground thingamabobers yo.

Its happens alot on earth, Will it happen again? Maybe someone should talk to me from the government
or something.

Dont forget to look up different goddesses and gods that are of earth yo, especially after the permise of
assassins creed. ;) <3 =) :) We getting tired of this shit, and i am still homeless dealing with so much bullshit
its stupid.

Maybe we should ask scientists and engineers first.... These dummies been looking everywhere all over portland
for nasa and spaceX. LAFF! HF.
