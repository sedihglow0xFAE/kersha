In school, we go to school for 4 years to get our first degree, bachelor's degree. Once complete after 4 years,
it takes another 4 years to get the masters degree in the field being learned.

That is 8 years total to get your masters degree.

The starting wage of someone with their masters degree once they get work is
higher than someone with their bachelors degree.

Once the masters degree is complete, there is the option to continue
education in school and get a PHD, this is a doctorate and give the
title doctor (it does not have to be a medical doctor, almost all fields that
require large ammounts of knowlege have a PHD option after a masters degree)

The PHD to become a doctor in the field being learned takes at least 8 years to achieve
making the person who graduated and got the PHD a doctor in the field of study.

as seen by the picture, the Bachelors degree give a general education of the field you are looking for.
A masters give education in the field the bachelors degree is in but more specific and detailed.
For a PHD, To be a doctor it takes at least 8 more years of education with
Research, a thesis, Projects and teaching classes and more.

Getting a PHD is the little bump on the picture compared to the
masters and bachelors degree, it shows that in all the time learning
and working on the PHD to become a doctor in the field of study, it is very
specific and highly detailed to the field of study.

Once you have a PDH in a field of study you are a master in that field,
You have learned everything in great detail in the field and mastered
it to obtain the title doctor.

So, looking for masks my ancient crone sister witchform goddess wore in her
past life that i was shown over a year ago, that shows who her human person was
on earth, i have found the closest masks to my crone sisters witchform goddess of her
ancient person must be a Witch Doctor.

Wut you think a witch doctor is.
