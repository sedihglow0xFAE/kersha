This is what i mean, guys are too afraid of being called gay to have a room like this. I get laid. They dont.

Why cant i have a room ;like this.
See, if guys have a room like this, guys call you gay, but when a girl walks in
your laid instantly. Why cant we have these things?

For those saying these rooms are not real because they look so good, look
at the bathtub that would get you boys called gay so you would never have one
like it, but men like me, sit in the tub with the bitches getting laid in rooms like
this. These are the things i like and one of the many many reasons other than being
confident in myself that make me not care if i get called gay by some dumb fuck. :) <3

For some reason these aesthetics and types of houses and rooms and yards are a reason why
christians think witches are evil and need to be burned, drowned or lynched. GOOD THOUGHTS AND
ACTIONS RETARDS. Stop sending your fucking people and your no name bitch ass things to kill me and
my spirits and friends so i can sit in my bathtub. Thanks.

  
And this one is for the minis.
